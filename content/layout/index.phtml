## About Layouts

A layout refers to the overall screen design of the site.
Specifically, it defines how elements such as the header, footer, and menu are arranged.
Once a layout is set, every page will output HTML with a consistent design.

## How is it different from a Template?

A template refers to reusable parts within a page.
In some frameworks, headers and footers are called as templates on each page.
In that case, every page requires code to call them, and if the code is forgotten, some pages will end up without a header or footer.
By using the layout feature, you can prevent such mistakes.

<section class="markdown" data-translation="true">
## Can I switch between multiple layouts?

Yes, itâ€™s possible. Layouts are located in `asset:/layout/`.
Which layout to use is configured in the `asset:/config/layout.php` file.

You can also change it dynamically as shown below.

```php
OP()->Config()->Set('layout',['name'=>'layout_name']);
```
</section>

<section class="markdown" data-translation="true">
## I want to temporarily turn off the layout

You can dynamically turn it ON or OFF as shown below.

```php
OP()->Config()->Set('layout',['execute'=>false]);
```
</section>

<section class="markdown" data-translation="true">
## I want to add a other layout

Run the following command:

```sh
php app.php path=/_develop/git/layout/add url=https://github.com/onepiece-framework/op-layout-model.git name=model
