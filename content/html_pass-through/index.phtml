	<h2>What is HTML Pass-through?</h2>
	<p>HTML pass-through refers to a framework's ability to directly output raw HTML without additional processing. It has the following characteristics:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Controller-less</li>
		<li>Can execute PHP scripts</li>
		<li>Automatic layout rendering</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Controller-less</h3>
	<p>
		Traditional frameworks required creating empty controllers and methods even for simple HTML pages that didn't need any backend logic.
		With the ONEPIECE Framework, files with an `.html` extension are directly output when accessed, eliminating the need for empty controllers or methods.
	</p>

	<h3>Can Execute PHP Scripts</h3>
	<p>
		Some frameworks offer an HTML pass-through feature, but in most cases, they simply output the HTML files as-is without the ability to execute any code.
		The HTML pass-through feature in the ONEPIECE Framework allows PHP scripts to be executed.
		Since it can access the framework’s functionality, it’s possible to output results from database queries.
		Of course, plain PHP can also be executed.
	</p>

	<h3>Automatic Layout Rendering</h3>
	<p>
		In many frameworks, HTML pass-through does not include layout rendering. Developers and designers have to manually add or update headers, footers, and other common page elements.
		The ONEPIECE Framework automatically renders headers, footers, side menus, and breadcrumb navigation—even when using HTML pass-through.
